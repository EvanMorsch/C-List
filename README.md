# C-List
List library for C aimed at wide, general, thread-safe usage with enough functionality to make list usage super convenient!

# A little about the design
Everytime I start a project, I find myself re-coding some pretty basic stuff like this because nothing fits my needs how I'd like. Well, I've had enough!

I loosely took inspiration from the Javascript Array API because I love the method selection and have never been left wanting whenever I use it. Whenever I come across a task that would benefit from an addition, I wouldn't mind adding it.

I tried to keep everything small, readable, and efficient enough not to embarrass myself but I'm sure theres room for improvement. Once I take note of them, I'll be quick to update this repo.

# Usage
For those interested (And so I remember...), I'll go fairly in-depth for portions of this part of the documentation. I feel like it helps to understand how best to use it when you understand it more than needed.

That being said, This project is *really* meant to be my attempt at never needing to worry about aa list ever again when I develop in C going forward so don't let the over-explanations bore you if you dont care.
